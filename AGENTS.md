# Instructions for CODEX contributors

## Testing expectations for GUI updates
- Whenever you introduce or modify any GUI surface (pages, views, interactive components), you **must** run the following commands and report them in your summary:
  - `npm test -- --runInBand`
  - `npm run build:client`
  - `npm run start`
- After starting the app, navigate to the impacted route(s) and capture an updated screenshot using the provided browser tooling.
- Include the screenshot path in your final notes so reviewers can trace the visual verification.

## GhostNet implementation principles
- Treat the **GhostNet** page as the sole surface for intentional UI enhancements. References to "the app" in these instructions should be interpreted as the GhostNet page unless a task explicitly states otherwise.
- Keep modifications to the legacy "Icarus" experience as lean as possible while still enabling GhostNet to function. Prefer composing new behavior around existing Icarus code instead of overhauling it.
- Maintain a unified visual language by reusing GhostNet's established color palette across any UI you touch.
- Ensure every UI adjustment remains responsive and accessible across a wide range of device sizes.
- Where it adds value, introduce tasteful animations and micro-interactions to help the interface feel vibrant and alive.
- Mirror the structural patterns and layout conventions of other Icarus pages so the product feels cohesive, while still honoring GhostNet's unique identity.

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` overrides them.
