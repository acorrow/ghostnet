# Instructions for CODEX contributors

## Testing expectations for GUI updates
- Whenever you introduce or modify any GUI surface (pages, views, interactive components), you **must** run the following commands and report them in your summary:
  - `npm test -- --runInBand`
  - `npm run build:client`
  - `npm run start`
- After starting the app, navigate to the impacted route(s) and capture an updated screenshot using the provided browser tooling.
- Include the screenshot path in your final notes so reviewers can trace the visual verification.

## GhostNet implementation principles
- Treat the **GhostNet** page as the sole surface for intentional UI enhancements. References to "the app" in these instructions should be interpreted as the GhostNet page unless a task explicitly states otherwise.
- Keep modifications to the legacy "Icarus" experience as lean as possible while still enabling GhostNet to function. Prefer composing new behavior around existing Icarus code instead of overhauling it.
- Maintain a unified visual language by reusing GhostNet's established color palette across any UI you touch.
- Ensure every UI adjustment remains responsive and accessible across a wide range of device sizes.
- Where it adds value, introduce tasteful animations and micro-interactions to help the interface feel vibrant and alive.
- Mirror the structural patterns and layout conventions of other Icarus pages so the product feels cohesive, while still honoring GhostNet's unique identity.
- Keep data tables outside of `SectionFrame` containers; tables should rely on GhostNet table shells (`dataTableContainer`, `dataTable`) for structure instead of being nested inside section frames.
- Table rows must never expand inline like a drawer. Selecting a row should always open a dedicated full-page view in the workspace, mirroring the behavior on the Find Trade Routes page. This ensures a clean experience on smaller displays.
- Full-page workspace detail views should follow the existing `routeDetail` layout in `ghostnet.module.css`: the purple back button anchors on the left, the heading/subhead stay centered, and key stats render in the detail metrics grid ahead of any tables.

### Palette hygiene
- Keep the GhostNet palette constrained to the core tokens defined in `src/client/css/pages/ghostnet.css`.
- When a design needs subtle variation, derive it with opacity or other modifiers from the shared tokens instead of introducing new hex values.
- Avoid dumping long lists of bespoke color variables into module files; rely on the shared palette for consistency and easier maintenance.
- Declare each palette token with a single color format (hex **or** rgb, not both) and document its primary usage with a block comment so future contributors understand the intent.
- Keep gradients lightweightâ€”prefer blending a small number of shared tokens with transparency rather than stacking many distinct color stops.

### GhostNet Purple Theme Specification
- **Primary hue:** GhostNet surfaces should lean on a rich royal purple (`#5D2EFF`) for primary actions, interactive accents, and key highlights.
- **Gradient treatments:** When gradients are needed, blend from the primary hue into a deeper indigo (`#2A0E82`) and finish with a soft ultraviolet (`#8C5CFF`) to preserve depth.
- **Neutrals:** Use a charcoal base (`#0D0B1A`) for backgrounds, `#1C1633` for elevated surfaces, and `#F5F1FF` for high-contrast text and iconography.
- **Supporting accents:** Emerald (`#29F3C3`) is the sanctioned success color, while warnings should leverage warm magenta (`#FF5FC1`); avoid introducing additional accent families.
- **Typography:** Headings remain in the existing GhostNet display face, but always tinted `#F5F1FF`; body copy should default to `rgba(245, 241, 255, 0.84)` to soften contrast on dark surfaces.
- **Shadows & glows:** Apply atmospheric glows using `rgba(93, 46, 255, 0.45)` with a 24px blur, and keep elevation shadows subtle (`rgba(13, 11, 26, 0.55)` at 12px blur, 0 offset).
- **Borders & dividers:** Use semi-transparent borders `rgba(140, 92, 255, 0.35)` for cards or panels; dividers should sit at `rgba(245, 241, 255, 0.16)`.
- **Interactive states:** Hover states brighten the primary hue by 8%, focus rings use a 2px outline of `#29F3C3`, and pressed states darken to `#2A0E82` with the glow removed.
- **Accessibility:** Maintain WCAG AA contrast; when text falls below the ratio, elevate the surface or swap to the lighter ultraviolet tone.

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` overrides them.

## Image and logo creation workflow
- When a task requires creating any image or logo, produce the asset in **SVG** format first.
- After generating the SVG, render it to **PNG**.
- Always include a view of the exported PNG in the chat response so reviewers can quickly validate the output.
